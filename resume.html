            <li>Delhi
                Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a match against
                the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs.
                His first half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against
                Haryana.[2] By the end of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest
                run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[3] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as
                the captain of the Under-15 team. In his first match of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory
                over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century
                with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 390
                runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[4][5] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned
                selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi Under-17 team. In the four matches that
                he played, Kohli accumulated a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs. The team's
                coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the
                field.[6][7] Kohli commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their
                victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the
                semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job.
                True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the
                tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first
                innings.[8] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging
                84.11.[9] </li>

        <ol>
            <li>Batting technique: Kohli has an impeccable batting technique, with a strong focus on footwork and a
                solid defense. He is equally adept at playing both fast bowling and spin, and can adapt his technique to
                suit different conditions and formats.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Ability to score runs under pressure: Kohli is known for his ability to score runs in high-pressure
                situations, whether it's in a run chase or in a critical match situation. He has a strong mental game,
                and is able to stay focused and composed even in the most challenging of circumstances.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Aggressive batting style: Kohli is an aggressive batsman who likes to dominate bowlers from the outset.
                He is not afraid to play his shots, and has a wide range of attacking strokes at his disposal.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Running between the wickets: Kohli is an excellent runner between the wickets, and is able to convert
                singles into twos and twos into threes with ease. This puts pressure on the fielding side and allows him
                to rotate the strike and keep the scoreboard ticking over. </li>
