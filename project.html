    and be up for auction ahead of the next season. Rohit has
    a massive fanbase who want to see him back at the helm of things
    at MI. Here is the tweet that is spreading this rumour, which is absolutely false.

    <h2>oth Avesh and Kohli hogged the limelight during the two RCB vs Lucknow Super Giants games in IPL 2023 for wrong
      reasons. The first match-up between RCB and LSG turned out to be a thriller, with KL Rahul's side emerging as the
      winners. The then LSG player, Avesh, who was on the pitch when the side successfully completed the run-chase
      against RCB, threw his helmet on the ground in celebration. The gesture saw Avesh earning a hefty fine later.

      The issue became a matter of debate before the Kohli vs Naveen-ul-Haq and Gautam Gambhir took over in their next
      game.

      RCB won the contest when the two teams clashed for the second time in IPL 2023. Kohli clearly vented his anger out
      after the victory and that led to his clash with LSG player Naveen and then mentor Gambhir. The tussle become one
      of the major controversial moments of IPL 2023.

      Talking about the upcoming IPL 2024 game, struggling RCB and high-flying RR bizarrely have similar worries to
      address when they face each other in Jaipur on Saturday.

      The eighth place where RCB are currently on the 10-team table is a fair indication of their troubles, but
      Rajasthan's all-win record so far do not necessarily mirror their turmoil.

      The Royal Challengers will have great memories of the last time they visited the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. However,
      the Royals unit is looking different in this edition. They have the confidence of three wins with themselves, and
      overhauling them this time will take a lot of work.

      Given how the wicket responded to the new ball at the beginning of the previous two games, someone like Mohammad
      Siraj could be necessary for the team. Let us now take a deeper analytical dive and find three potential
      match-winners for the team in this game.

      3 Important players for RCB vs RR
      Faf du Plessis
      The RCB skipper started the season on a good note against CSK. Even though he did not score big in that game, he
      looked in good rhythm. But since then, Faf du Plessis has been completely off-colour.

      RCB will be hoping that Faf regains his form in this game and helps Virat Kohli in providing the team with a solid
      start. Du Plessis's form against RR in the last season will give positivity to the team management. In IPL 2023,
      Faf du Plessis scored half-centuries in both games against RR. He scored 117 runs in two matches at an average of
      58.5 and a strike rate of 131.8.

      Glenn Maxwell
      The Aussie all-rounder has been RCB's biggest disappointment in this edition so far. Glenn Maxwell has scored only
      31 runs in the four matches in IPL 2024. But there is a big chance that Maxwell will return to form in this game,
      as his record against RR and at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium is pretty decent.

      Maxwell has scored 403 runs in 14 innings against RR at an average of 36.6 and a strike rate of 167.9. His stats
      were brilliant against RR in the last season too. He scored 131 runs at an average of 65.5 and a strike rate 167.9
      in two matches. Maxwell has so far played three T20 matches at the venue and scored half-centuries in two. He has
      an average of 62 here and a strike rate of 158.97.

      Mohammed Siraj
      Mohammed Siraj's performance with the ball has been below average in the tournament so far. He has picked up just
      three wickets in four matches and has conceded runs.

      Former India batter Manoj Tiwary feels that Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) tearaway pacer Mayank Yadav is ready to
      play for India at the T20 World Cup later this year. Tiwary's comments came after the Delhi-born pacer humbled the
      Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) batter with his express. He clocked 156.7 kph during the game and bowled the
      fastest delivery in the ongoing edition and overall the fourth fastest in the history of the entire tournament. In
      his first two IPL games for LSG, Mayank has taken six wickets, conceding just 41 runs.

      Speaking after the match between RCB and LSG, Tiwary said that if he was the selector, he would pick Mayank as
      India's third-choice pacer after Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami.

      "If I was in Ajit Agarkar's position I would put him in. Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammad Shami and then him. Looking at
      Mayank's form, action and release it looks like he is in control and it feels like if you give him a bigger stage,
      he will deliver. With IPL where many overseas players do come in and get them out, your confidence will also go
      up," Tiwary said in a discussion on Cricbuzz.
